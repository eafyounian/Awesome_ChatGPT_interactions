```

**Response**

```
In the land of thousand lakes,
Where the Northern Lights awake,
The people gather once again,
To choose their leaders without disdain.

The drums of democracy sound,
As the winds of change surround,
For the Finnish Parliament's election is nigh,
And the voters' voices shall amplify.

Amidst the forests and the fells,
Where the bear and reindeer dwell,
The candidates brave the wintry gale,
Their message strong, their passion pale.

From the coasts of Helsinki,
To the fields of Lapland free,
The people's will shall soon prevail,
As they cast their ballots without fail.

The parties' banners wave high,
Their platforms clear and nigh,
For the Finnish people to decide,
Who shall steer the nation with pride.

Let the wisdom of our ancestors guide,
As we seek a brighter future, side by side,
For Finland, our homeland true,
And the parliamentary election, anew.
