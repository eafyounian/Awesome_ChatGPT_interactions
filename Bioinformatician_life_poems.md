```
A Khayyam style Rubaʿi about bioinformatician life
```

**Response**

```
A bioinformatician's life
Is filled with endless data strife
We toil through lines of code
To understand the human genome's code

Our minds are sharp and keen
We make discoveries unforeseen
We are the gatekeepers of life
Bioinformatics, our endless strife.
```
